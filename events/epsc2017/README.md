# OP Data Café @ EPSC 2017 (Riga, Latvia)

[SWM1.9 OpenPlanetary Data Analysis Cafe](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2017/session/26867) (public)  
Convener: A. P. Rossi

Thu, 21 Sep, 11:00–13:45

The splinter is intended to be a participative workshop with hackathons and collaborative data handling and analysis components using state-of-the-art community-driven open source tools. Both junior and senior scientists willing to share expertise, tools, science use cases and issues are welcome.

[Summary Report (OP Blog post)](https://medium.com/openplanetary/openplanetary-data-caf%C3%A9-at-epsc-2017-95d4cf90cdd8)

## Topics to be possibly touched
* Version control - git & workflow for planetary science
* (Open) Tools for planetary science, see also [#vespamap17 short summary](https://aprossi.github.io/vespamap17tools/):
  * [ISIS3](https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov)
  * [ASP](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/)
  * Open Source GIS (Grass, QGIS)
  * Open Source ML (Python/Scikit-{Image,Learn})
  * ...
* Using ArXiv and preprint services for sharing (legally) paywalled articles, e.g. see [(old, to be possibly updated) summary](http://openplanetary.co/blog/science/publishing-tips.html)
* [Making code citable](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
* [OpenPlanetaryMap](http://openplanetarymap.org/)
* Using Jupyter notebook in your research (and teaching) workflow, e.g. [examples from pg-book](https://github.com/openplanetary/planetarygeology-book) (work in progress)
* [Using VESPA planetary virtual observatory](https://github.com/epn-vespa/vespamap17-hackathon) (see also dedicated [Session SMW1.3](http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2017/session/26317))
* Python for beginners.
* Advanges of specify an Open Source License for your code.
* What are and why are useful DVCS/git/hub/mercurial. People could contribute to your code!
* Getting DOI and distribute your code : expand your user base and get contributor.

### Split in groups 

Each person will gather people interested in one topic and expand discussion/slides/hands one.
