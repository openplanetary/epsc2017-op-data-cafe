### Notes

Problems / what are the main teaching/learning objectives?
- creator more than consumer
- learn, pause, break/build/create, continue
- exploring/ understanding worlds
- how is something related to something else?
- skills
- how long/how often?
- onboarding students
- what information do you need to provide to teacher/student?
- how do you make it collaborative?
- educational methotology (teaching the teacher to make it usable for the students)

Users/audience:
- teacher (scared of technology)
- students (10-12 years)

Possible solutions: to 
- propose a few existing presentation/course
- allow teacher to build their own course
- allow students learn, pause, break/build/create/explore, continue (interactive learning, eg: https://scrimba.com)
- sharing a map space
- using keywords and semantic analytics for individual assessment
- narrative for getting through a map

Example:
