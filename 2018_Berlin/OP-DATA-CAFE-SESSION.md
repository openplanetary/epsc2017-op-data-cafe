#Open Data Caf√® II - Berlin 2018

The splinter is intended to be a participative workshop with hackathons and collaborative data handling and analysis components using state-of-the-art community-driven open source tools. Although informally driven, the session will address problems and issues related to planetary science activities related to development and publication of software and high level data products. 

OpenPlanetary (OP) is a community-driven initiative and effort to address the need of the planetary science community for sharing ideas and collaborating on common planetary research and data analysis problems, new challenges, and opportunities.

Both junior and senior scientists willing to share expertise, tools, science use cases and issues are welcome.
