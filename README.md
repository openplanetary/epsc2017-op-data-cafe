# OP Data Café

**The OpenPlanetary (OP) Data Café is a place for planetary scientists and software developers to meet and share, discuss, and solve common issues around the topic of data handling and analysis.**

We organise OP Data Cafés during splinter sessions at scientific conferences, following an unconference format. An unconference is a participant-driven meeting where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the event. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room given a talk, although any format is permitted.

## How to participate?

Prior to or during an OP Data Café, we can:

* Introduce a tool/plugin/solution for solving a particular problem
* Describe a problem you're having in your data analysis workflow (with the hope to find someone who can help you. If not, you can document it as GH Issue-> clinic)
* Propose/conduct a tutorial (1h/2h)
* Propose a co-creating/hacking activity (eg: op-resources, planetpy, opm, etc...)

## Typical structure/agenda

The structure/agenda of an OP Data Café can vary depending of the room space, number of attendees and proposed topics.

1. **Welcome/intro** (from organisers: OP, this event)
2. **Agenda creation**: participants propose topics (participants can propose topics prior to the workshop), and vote (if many participants)
3. **Group activities**: participants split up into groups/tracks
4. **Wrap up**: all participants reconvene and each group quickly reports on outcome/findings from discussions/tutorials/hacks
