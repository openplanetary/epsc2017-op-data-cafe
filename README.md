# OP Data Café

OP Data Cafés are intended for planetary scientists and software developers to meet and share, discuss, and solve common issues around the topic of data handling and analysis. They are typically organised during splinter sessions at scientific conferences, following an unconference format.

An unconference is a participant-driven meeting where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the event. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room given a talk, although any format is permitted.
