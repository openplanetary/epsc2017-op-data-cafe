# OP Data Café

**The OpenPlanetary (OP) Data Café is a place for planetary scientists and software developers to meet and share, discuss, and solve common issues around the topic of data handling and analysis.**

We organise OP Data Cafés during splinter sessions at scientific conferences, following an unconference format. An unconference is a participant-driven meeting where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the event. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room given a talk, although any format is permitted.

## How to participate?

Prior to or at the beginning an OP Data Café, you can either:

1. **Introduce a tool/plugin/solution** for solving a particular problem
2. **Describe a problem** you're having in your data analysis workflow, with the hope to find some people who could help you. If not, you can document it as GH Issue-> clinic)
3. **Propose/conduct a tutorial**
4. **Propose a co-creating/hacking activity** (eg: op-resources, planetpy, opm, etc...)

or simply come along with the intent to learn and/or share your expertise, helping other to solve their problems or collaborate on community-based projects.

## Typical structure

The structure/agenda of an OP Data Café can vary depending of the room space, number of attendees and proposed topics.

1. **Welcome & introduction**: organisers introduce OpenPlanetary and the 
2. **Agenda creation**: participants propose topics (participants can propose topics prior to the workshop), and vote (if many participants)
3. **Group activities**: participants split up into groups/tracks
4. **Wrap up**: all participants reconvene and each group quickly reports on outcome/findings from discussions/tutorials/hacks
