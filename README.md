# OP Data Café

**The OpenPlanetary (OP) Data Café is a place for planetary scientists and software developers to meet and share, discuss, and solve common issues around the topic of data handling and analysis.**

We organise OP Data Cafés during splinter sessions at scientific conferences, following an unconference format. An unconference is a participant-driven meeting where the agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the event. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room given a talk, although any format is permitted.

## What to expect?

At an OP Data Café, you can expect to learn new tools or techniques that can help you in your workflow, to find help for a problem you have, and to participate in co-creating activities related to community-driven projects.

The structure, content and duration of an OP Data Café can vary depending of the room space, number of attendees and proposed topics, but it typically follows the following agenda:

1. **Welcome & introduction** (~15 min): organisers introduce OpenPlanetary and the OP Data Café of the day.
2. **Agenda creation** (~15 min): participants propose topics (participants can propose topics prior to the workshop), and vote (if many participants)
3. **Group activities** (~30 min - 2 hours): participants split up into groups around a table and start the chosen activity.
4. **Wrap up** (~3 min / group): all participants reconvene and each group quickly reports on outcome/findings from discussions/tutorials/hacks

## How to contribute?

Prior to or at the beginning an OP Data Café, you can either:

1. **Introduce a tool/plugin/solution** for solving a particular problem. Your presentation should be short and encourage open discussions at your table.
2. **Describe a problem** you're having in your data analysis workflow, with the hope to find some people who could help you. If not, you can document it as GH Issue-> clinic)
3. **Propose a tutorial**
4. **Propose a co-creating/hacking activity** (eg: op-resources, planetpy, opm, tutorials, etc...)

or simply come along with the intent to learn and/or share your expertise, helping other to solve their problems or collaborate on community-based projects.
